# network-centralities-community-detection

In this project, I explained some of the concept related to networks such as centrality metrics and visualizations of both adjacency matrix and community detection. In top of that, I have made use of PageRank and Ego networks with providing illustrations of these concepts using colored networks through networkx python package. Finally, virus infection simulations (SI and SIR models) were built and visualized.
